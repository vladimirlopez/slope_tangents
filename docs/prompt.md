Create an HTML5 web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should have the following features:

1. A table where users can input x and y values (minimum of 3 points required for a quadratic fit).
2. A button to plot the data and perform a quadratic regression (least squares fit).
3. A canvas (e.g., using Chart.js or plain HTML5 Canvas) to display:
   - The input data points.
   - The best-fit quadratic curve based on the input data.
4. An interactive slider or input box to select an x-value within the domain of the fitted parabola.
5. When an x-value is selected:
   - Highlight the corresponding point on the quadratic curve.
   - Calculate and display the slope of the tangent line at that point.
   - Draw the tangent line on the graph.
6. Style the app with simple, responsive CSS for clarity and usability.

Do not use any backend code. All functionality should be done client-side. Keep the code modular and well-commented. Use plain JavaScript unless a library like Chart.js or math.js makes things clearer.
